# Galaxy-S8-and-S9-sales-performance-according-to-social-media-data

This project evaluates how the social media data can be leveraged to analyze the sales performance of galaxy s8 and s9. In order to narrow down the project outcome, we are going to predict the sales numbers for both mobile phone based on the trends on youtube search, web search and google shopping. The sales data is elaborated from several news/snapshots, while the social media data is retrievied from google trends



<b>Research questions</b> : How to predict the sales numbers of galaxy s8 and s9 accoding to trends on youtube search and web search?


<b>Trend scale</b> : Worldwide


<b>Methods</b> : 


1. Assume that The trend is the independent variable, Here, Trend is expected to have a positive influence on the dependent variable. In this case, the dependent variable will be the number of sales of the samsung galaxy S8 (or S9). If the datasheet shows a good linear correation between sales and trend, we can predict the future sales of those mobile phones. Therefore, the first hypothesis would be:<b>H1 : The number of sales increases proportionally when the number of searches on youtube and web search increase. </b>



2. When someone is interested in one product, it will be a certain time until that product is actually bought. This time is defined as "time-lag". Thus, the linearity in H1 would be more make sense if we take the time-lag into account. <b>H2 : Considering time-lag would make a better linearity beween trend and sales.    </b>



3. According to Ravaja et. al. [1], The products that have a lower price would influence the purchase intent. Therefore, the time-lag of the more expensive product supposed to be higher than the cheaper one. Since galaxy s9 comes with higher price, the third hypothesis would be written as : <b>H3 : The time-lag is expected to be longer for galaxy s9.</b>




If those hypothesis are proven, we can provide a model to predict the future sales according to the trend.
